docs: Enhance README with logo, bot link, and RPi compatibility

This commit enhances the project's `README.md` with visual elements and important compatibility information.

- **Visuals:**
  - Added the official MooDuck bot logo (`assets/mduck-logo.png`) to the README for better branding and recognition.
  - Included a new Telegram badge linking directly to the bot ([@mduckbot](https://t.me/mduckbot)) for easy access and promotion.

- **Compatibility:**
  - Introduced a "Tested Environments" section, highlighting the project's successful and efficient operation on a low-spec Raspberry Pi 5 8GB. This emphasizes its lightweight design and suitability for resource-constrained deployments.
